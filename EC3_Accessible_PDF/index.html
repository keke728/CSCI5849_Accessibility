      <p>For this assignment, I modified a research proposal I wrote before to be an accessible pdf and tested it with the eAccessibility checker.</p>
      <p>I followed the instructions to create an accessible pdf as described in the  <a href="http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/">Accessible PDF Author Guide</a> step by step.</p>
      <p>Then I uploaded my pdf to the checker and passed most of the tests, with  an exception on the inconsistent heading levels.</p>
      <p>The problem with that was I don't have a licence to the Adobe Acrobat Pro but a trial version, which caused the software to keep crashing </p>
      <p>while I was trying to manually add the headings.</p>
      <p>Overall it went pretty good to add accessibility features to the pdf and I do believe a small deed like this could make a big difference</p>
      <p>for people with impaired abilities to access the pdf documents</p>
