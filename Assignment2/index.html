      <h2>*Description*</h2>
      <p>In this study, we compared the pointing performance between Touch Screen and Touch Pad using GoFitts in a labtop setting.</p>
      <p>We conducted a within-subject study to test each participant's performance under two conditions.</p>
      <p>Our task was to let the user point and click on the filled circle as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>
      <p>Participant: 2, Task Type: 2D, Number of Trials: 7</p>

      <h2>*Summary*</h2>
      <p>In our test, Keke started with touch screen, while Supriya started with touch pad for counterbalancing purpose. </p>
      <p>Our study shows that the user generally performs better on the touch pad than on the touch screen.</p>
      <p>It takes less time and yields a lower error rate on the touch pad than on the touch screen.</p>
